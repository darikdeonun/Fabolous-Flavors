# Fabolous Flavors
A common theme among America's most popular fast-food sauces is mayo. Whether mingling with mustard, onions, or Sriracha, the creamy condiment presents a broad canvas of flavor opportunities and dipping options. After ketchup, tomato sauce (basically thicker fancier ketchup) and bbq sauce are the most popular. KFC sauce is a creamy and tangy sauce loaded with flavor. It features mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, onion juice, garlic, Tabasco, and chili sauce. It can be served with fried chicken, enjoyed as a dipping sauce, or added to other dishes for flavor. They include velout√© (blonde sauce), bechamel (white sauce), tomato (red sauce), hollandaise (butter sauce), and espagnole (brown sauce). We turned to Zifchak to learn from [Fabolous Flavors](https://fabolousflavors.com/) how each of the five mother sauces are made and how we can use them when cooking at home.
